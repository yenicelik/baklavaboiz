Bumblebee - Assignments for LIS 2017

If you want a quick intro on how to use git, this ['No Deep Shit Guide'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is really awesome!

If you want to use IPython Notebook, you will find an installation guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). We can always switch to 'vanilla' python, if you prefer to work with single scripts.

The library we will use most often will be [numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), often referred to as 'np'. You can import numpy into python with

`import numpy as np`

Another library we might use is [Scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Not a big fan of this, but might come in handy.

For pre- and postprocessing, [pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is really useful.

If you need to install any of these packages, they come preinstalled with Anaconda. Alternatively, you can use python's package manager 'pip' to install those. In that case, simply enter in the terminal:

`pip install -U scikit-learn`

Simple as that. Let's crush them :)
